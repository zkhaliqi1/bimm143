## PDB statistics

Here we inspect the types of structures in the main database for 3D biomolecular data - the PDB

> Q1 Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

```{r}
# read in file
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)

# calculate percentage values for each 'method'
ans <- stats$Total / sum(stats$Total) * 100
# Divide by the sum of all the totals to get the percentage of each method
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round(ans, 2)
```



> Q2 Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein? Aim to have a rendered GitHub document with working code that yields your answers.

```{r}
round(sum(stats$Proteins) / sum(stats$Total) * 100, 2)
```

> Q3 Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many
HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
